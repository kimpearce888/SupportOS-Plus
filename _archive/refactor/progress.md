# Refactor Progress — Live State

Last updated: session 1 (2026-11-12). Update rule: every session updates
this file before ending. Statuses: `pending` / `in_progress` / `done` /
`terminal` (done + closed in `complete.md`) / `dropped` (with reason in
`memory.md`).

## CURRENT POINTER

- Next task: **R1.2 — core/ai_* strip** (~13 files; see `plan.md` §7 R1.2).
- Pre-flight: confirm CI green on the session-2 head (run id in session log).
- Session counter: 2 completed (R1.0 + R1.1 done).
- Environment: toolchain installed this session; target/ warm but disk-tight
  (see gotcha G-05 — delete target/debug/incremental when links bus-error).

## Task states

| R1.3 core/sync+workers strip | pending | |
| R1.4 core/helpscout strip | pending | |

| R1.8 app-shell/pages-A strip | pending | 7 largest pages |
| R1.9 app-shell/pages-B strip | pending | + 26 kittest suites |
| R1.10 comment closeout | pending | lint-attr cleanup + zero-check |
| R2.1–R2.5 unnecessary code | pending | see plan §7 R2 |
| R3.1–R3.6 DRY | pending | see plan §7 R3 |
| R4.1–R4.5 clean code | pending | see plan §7 R4 |

## Session log

### Session 2 — 2026-11-12
- Pre-flight: sandbox reset AGAIN (clone + toolchain gone) — re-provisioned
  per handover §2 (~15 min incl. toolchain download).
- R1.0 built: `crates/xtask/src/strip.rs` (lexer, ~280 lines + 38 unit
  tests), wired as `xtask strip-comments [--check] [paths...]`; default root
  `crates`; skips target/.git dirs; report: files scanned/rewritten, whole
  lines + inline comments removed. One test-expectation fix during
  development (inline block comment keeps the space AFTER it; rustfmt
  canonicalizes).
- Local battery green: gate, fmt, clippy x2, tests x2 (520 + 528),
  verify-icons, pilot --check.
- R1.1 executed: catalog is ALREADY comment-free (0 lines across 8 files —
  plan batch was sized from the session-1 aggregate numbers); xtask had 59
  lines in package.rs (56) + bin/xtask.rs (3). Subset --check green (13/13).
- Commits: `88e1770` (R1.0), R1.1 (this session's second commit).
- CI: `<fill: run id + conclusion>`.

### Session 1 — 2026-11-12
- Research: full metrics snapshot (plan §6); read the no-simulation gate
  end-to-end (allowlist semantics: stale entries harmless; new marker lines
  fail); confirmed `missing_docs` is warn+allow (comment removal is
  clippy-safe); confirmed no local Vulkan (kittest is CI-only); confirmed
  rust-lang.org reachable (toolchain installable on demand).
- Environment: sandbox had been reset — re-cloned the repo, re-set git
  identity; toolchain NOT reinstalled this session (R0 needs no cargo;
  next session must provision per `handover.md` §2).
- Created this folder: plan/progress/complete/handover/memory.
- Executed R0 (pipeline alignment): traceability-gate step removed from
  ci.yml and release.yml; `scripts/gate_traceability.py` →
  `_archive/scripts/`; `docs/audit/design-contract-v1.md` +
  `docs/audit/acceptance/traceability-matrix.md` → `_archive/docs/audit/`;
  root `docs/` removed entirely (root = code + code-only build machinery).
  Verified: zero references to `gate_traceability|docs/audit` outside
  `_archive`; no-simulation gate clean.
- Commits: `38f480b` (framework), `c6ab15d` (R0).
- CI: run#301 (id 43227385165) — completed / success on all four lanes
  (check, packages x86_64, packages arm64, kittest snapshot locks).
  R0 terminal; evidence in `complete.md`.
