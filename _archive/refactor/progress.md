# Refactor Progress — Live State

Last updated: session 3 (2026-11-12). Update rule: every session updates
this file before ending. Statuses: `pending` / `in_progress` / `done` /
`terminal` (done + closed in `complete.md`) / `dropped` (with reason in
`memory.md`).

## CURRENT POINTER

- Next task: **R1.10 — comment closeout** (delete the redundant
  `warn(missing_docs)` + `allow(missing_docs)` pairs in catalog/core;
  the whole-tree `strip-comments --check crates` is ALREADY green —
  205/205 this session; run the full battery + CI, record the exact
  removed-comment count; see `plan.md` §7 R1.10).
- Pre-flight: confirm CI green on the session-3 final head (run id in
  session log). If the session ended mid-CI, the run may still be
  in flight — next session must wait for it.
- Session counter: 3 completed (R1.0-R1.9 executed — session 3 ran four
  batches; see log). THE ENTIRE crates TREE IS COMMENT-FREE (205/205).
- Environment: toolchain installed this session (cold target/); G-05 hit
  three times (ld Bus error during app-shell test link — `rm -rf
  target/debug/incremental` + retry fixed each). Per-crate test lanes
  mandatory, ONE lane per tool call (the 10-min window killed a two-lane
  chain mid-run once; rerun was green).

## Task states

## Session log

### Session 3 — 2026-11-12
- Pre-flight: sandbox reset AGAIN (clone + toolchain gone) — re-provisioned
  per handover §2 (re-clone ~1 min + toolchain 1.99.1 ~4 min).
- CI on the session-2 final head: run#307 (id 43293054746) — completed /
  success on `7a7b264` (R1.5 CI-verified; the session-2 "CI pending" note
  resolved). Green base confirmed before starting the batch.
- R1.6 executed: the stripper's --check pass over all of `crates/core`
  listed exactly the 26 files still carrying comments (the plan's
  `core/tests/` path does not exist — all tests are inline
  `#[cfg(test)]` modules, so the batch is simply "the rest of core/src").
  Strip removed 479 whole comment lines + 1 inline comment; `cargo fmt
  --all` produced 2 reflow insertions (automation.rs: trailing comment on
  `enabled: true,`; embeddings.rs: comment-only match arm collapsed to
  `{}`). Biggest files: automation 87, knowledge_store 50, embeddings 34,
  intelligence_features 35, custom_objects 33, business_hours 26,
  ticket_states 25, webhook 23, notifications 21, inbox 17, webhook_handler
  17, webhook_health 18, chats 16, notification_sweep 14.
- Battery: gate clean, fmt --check clean, clippy workspace (2m22s) +
  sandbox lane (41s) clean, core 520 passed (472s), core-sandbox 528
  passed (466s), catalog+xtask 56 passed, app-shell 293+2 passed (290s,
  after one G-05 retry), verify-icons verified, cumulative subset --check
  clean (135/135 across core+catalog+xtask). audit.rs untouched this
  batch (invariant 7 moot).
- G-05 recurred exactly as documented: disk hit 94% (657M free) during
  the app-shell test-binary link → `ld terminated with signal 7 [Bus
  error]` on kittest_widgets/kittest_onboarding_page → `rm -rf
  target/debug/incremental` freed 2.6G → retry green. Session-2's memory
  entry held; nothing new to add to G-05.
- Note for R1.9: the 26 kittest test binaries DO build+link in the default
  app-shell lane (they carry 0 test fns locally — the fns are
  kittest-ui-gated), so an R1.9 strip touching `crates/app-shell/tests/`
  is exercised by the default lane's link step. Disk headroom ≥2G required
  for that lane (G-05 budget).
- R1.7 executed (same session, after run#308 went green on the R1.6 head):
  --check over the plan's 17 infra paths listed 11 dirty of 19 scanned
  (app/chrome 5, app/mod 82, chart 25, design/controls 39, design/mod 225,
  lib 3, main 2, mention_popup 7, palette 33, task_bridge 1, workers_host
  14-line region). Strip removed 429 whole lines + 2 inline comments.
- G-07 discovered and hit twice: comments had been masking clippy lints.
  design/mod.rs badge() — the UXF-1-1 comment sat between `let response =
  ui.interact(..)` and the `response` tail → let_and_return once stripped
  → fixed by returning `ui.interact(..)` directly. workers_host.rs
  restart() — the AU2-13g comment sat between outer and inner if →
  collapsible_if once stripped → fixed by folding `&& let Err(join_err)
  = block_on(prev)` into the chain (same short-circuit semantics).
  Recorded as G-07 in memory.md; clippy lane now runs immediately after
  fmt, before the test lanes, to catch this class early in R1.8/R1.9.
- Battery: gate clean, fmt --check clean, clippy workspace (6s after fix)
  + sandbox lane clean, app-shell 293+2 (297s), core 520 (452s),
  core-sandbox 528 (473s), catalog+xtask 56, verify-icons verified,
  cumulative subset --check clean (154/154 across core+catalog+xtask+
  app-shell-infra).
- G-05 hit a second time mid-battery at the same spot (app-shell test
  link, 77% full): `rm -rf target/debug/incremental` + retry green.
- R1.8 executed (same session, after run#309 went green on the R1.7 head):
  the seven 2K+ pages (inbox 4715, settings 3316, knowledge 2647,
  reports 2374, ai_center 2299, custom_objects 2092, outreach 1844) —
  all 7 carried comments. Strip removed 864 whole lines + 1 inline
  (inbox 226, knowledge 150, outreach 157, custom_objects 132,
  settings 114, ai_center 55, reports 51; 8 fmt reflow insertions: the
  knowledge.rs test trailing comment + a custom_objects.rs method-chain
  reflow).
- G-07 hit exactly as predicted (twice more): custom_objects.rs +
  outreach.rs empty-state CTA blocks — the guard comment sat between
  `if types.is_empty()` / `if campaigns.is_empty()` and the nested
  `if design::empty_state_cta(..)`. Fixed by the same collapse
  (`is_empty() && empty_state_cta(..)`) — the CTA render is still
  gated on the empty list, pixel-neutral.
- Battery: gate clean, fmt --check clean, clippy workspace (5.8s after
  fix) + sandbox lane clean, app-shell 293+2 (289s), core 520 (459s),
  core-sandbox 528 (483s), catalog+xtask 56, verify-icons verified,
  cumulative subset --check clean (161/161 across core+catalog+xtask+
  app-shell-infra+pages-A).
- Process slip caught by the tool window: chaining core + sandbox lanes
  in one command exceeded 10 min and the call was killed mid-second-lane
  (the core lane itself had already passed — log confirmed 520/520;
  clean rerun also green). Lesson recorded in the pointer: ONE test lane
  per tool call.
- R1.9 executed (same session, after run#310 went green on the R1.8 head):
  scope = pages B (16 pages + pages/mod.rs + queries.rs) + the whole
  `crates/app-shell/tests/` tree (25 kittest suites + style_lint.rs).
  Strip removed 1011 whole comment lines + 1 inline from 44 of 51
  scanned (1 fmt reflow: issue_radar's `#[allow(unused_mut)]` trailing
  comment trimmed). NO G-07 hits — the tests-tree comments masked no
  lints. Kittest suite file names + test fn names untouched (D-06
  intact); the app-shell lane re-linked every stripped kittest binary.
- MILESTONE: `strip-comments --check crates` — the WHOLE-TREE zero
  check that R1.10 was to enforce — is already green (205/205 scanned).
  The entire Rust source tree (4 crates, 205 .rs files) is comment-free.
- Battery: gate clean, fmt --check clean, clippy workspace (5.9s) +
  sandbox lane clean, app-shell 293+2 (293s), core 520 (501s),
  core-sandbox 528 (464s), catalog+xtask 56, verify-icons verified.
- Session-3 tally: four batches (R1.6-R1.9), 2,783 whole comment lines
  + 5 inline comments removed, 5 G-07 masked-lint fixes (2 x
  let_and_return/collapsible_if in infra, 2 x collapsible_if empty-state
  CTAs in pages A, 0 in pages B), 3 G-05 disk retries, all four CI runs
  green so far (308, 309, 310, 311 — the R1.9 run concluded green at
  session close; all four heads CI-verified).

### Session 2 — 2026-11-12
- Pre-flight: sandbox reset AGAIN (clone + toolchain gone) — re-provisioned
  per handover §2 (~15 min incl. toolchain download).
- R1.0 built: `crates/xtask/src/strip.rs` (lexer, ~280 lines + 38 unit
  tests), wired as `xtask strip-comments [--check] [paths...]`; default root
  `crates`; skips target/.git dirs; report: files scanned/rewritten, whole
  lines + inline comments removed. One test-expectation fix during
  development (inline block comment keeps the space AFTER it; rustfmt
  canonicalizes).
- Local battery green: gate, fmt, clippy x2, tests x2 (520 + 528),
  verify-icons, pilot --check.
- R1.1 executed: catalog is ALREADY comment-free (0 lines across 8 files —
  plan batch was sized from the session-1 aggregate numbers); xtask had 59
  lines in package.rs (56) + bin/xtask.rs (3). Subset --check green (13/13).
- Commits: `88e1770` (R1.0), `6362842` (R1.1).
- CI: run#303 (id 43269465470) — completed / success on `6362842`
  (R1.0 + R1.1 CI-verified).
- R1.2 executed (same session, time allowed): 90 comment lines removed from
  7 of 15 core/ai_* files (ai_center 17, ai_lm_studio 33, ai_evidence 13,
  ai_hub 10, ai_local 8, ai_pipeline/mod 6, ai_prompts 3; ai_attributes,
  ai_tools, ai_eval, ai_memory_guard, ai_provider were already clean).
  Full battery green: gate, fmt, clippy x2, tests x2 (293+2+520+56,
  528 sandbox), verify-icons, cumulative subset --check 28/28.
  Disk discipline applied (G-05: freed incremental before sandbox link).
- R1.3 executed (same session): 162 whole comment lines + 1 trailing comment
  (jobs.rs tick line) removed from 8 of 13 files (execute.rs 62,
  workers/mod 48, connectors 20, loopback 8, api_queue 11, events 5, jobs 6,
  sync_engine/mod 2). Cumulative subset --check 41/41. CI run#304 green
  on the R1.2 head mid-batch. Battery executed as per-crate lanes (the
  10-min tool window kills a full `--workspace` run after cached compile;
  per-crate == same coverage): catalog+xtask 56, app-shell 293+2,
  core 520, core-sandbox 528 — all green; clippy x2 and fmt green before
  the lanes.
- Session-2 disk incidents (for G-05/G-07 refinement): sandbox link
  bus-error fixed by rm incremental; later ENOSPC fixed by
  `cargo clean -p supportos-plus-core` (2.6G freed) + rebuild.
- R1.4 executed (same session): 26 comment lines removed from 3 of 9 files
  (it_lm_studio 16, it_helpscout 6, helpscout_real/mod 4; helpscout/,
  oauth_state, mirror, mockserver already clean). CI run#305 green on the
  R1.3 head mid-batch. Full per-crate battery: clippy x2, core 520,
  core-sandbox 528 (after clean -p core), catalog+xtask 56, app-shell
  293; verify-icons; cumulative subset --check 50/50.
- R1.5 executed (same session): 54 comment lines removed from 6 of 23 files
  (maintenance 21, people_store/mod 13, migrations/cleanup 14, db 2,
  audit 3, backup_service 1). Invariant 7 held: audit.rs's two gate-allowlist
  lines are pure code lines (no trailing comments) — gate re-ran clean
  with zero allowlist changes. Cumulative subset --check 73/73. Battery:
  clippy x2, core 520, core-sandbox 528, catalog+xtask 56, app-shell 293,
  verify-icons, gate — all green. CI run#306 green on the R1.4 head
  mid-batch.

### Session 1 — 2026-11-12
- Research: full metrics snapshot (plan §6); read the no-simulation gate
  end-to-end (allowlist semantics: stale entries harmless; new marker lines
  fail); confirmed `missing_docs` is warn+allow (comment removal is
  clippy-safe); confirmed no local Vulkan (kittest is CI-only); confirmed
  rust-lang.org reachable (toolchain installable on demand).
- Environment: sandbox had been reset — re-cloned the repo, re-set git
  identity; toolchain NOT reinstalled this session (R0 needs no cargo;
  next session must provision per `handover.md` §2).
- Created this folder: plan/progress/complete/handover/memory.
- Executed R0 (pipeline alignment): traceability-gate step removed from
  ci.yml and release.yml; `scripts/gate_traceability.py` →
  `_archive/scripts/`; `docs/audit/design-contract-v1.md` +
  `docs/audit/acceptance/traceability-matrix.md` → `_archive/docs/audit/`;
  root `docs/` removed entirely (root = code + code-only build machinery).
  Verified: zero references to `gate_traceability|docs/audit` outside
  `_archive`; no-simulation gate clean.
- Commits: `38f480b` (framework), `c6ab15d` (R0).
- CI: run#301 (id 43227385165) — completed / success on all four lanes
  (check, packages x86_64, packages arm64, kittest snapshot locks).
  R0 terminal; evidence in `complete.md`.
