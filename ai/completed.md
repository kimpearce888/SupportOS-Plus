## Completed

### Batch 1 — 2026-10-18 (commit `560a5ce`, CI run `39112162370`: success)

**1. Add `LICENSE` (MIT, matching manifests)**
- Work: `LICENSE` file added at repo root with the standard MIT text (copyright 2026 kimpearce888).
- Verification: `cargo deny check licenses` passes with MIT in the allow list (local + CI);
  the workspace `license = "MIT"` declaration and the file now agree.

**2. Add CI: fmt + clippy + test + cargo-deny**
- Work: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on every push/PR: `cargo fmt --all --check`,
  `cargo clippy` (catalog/core/xtask, `--all-targets -D warnings`), `cargo test -p
  supportos-plusplus-core`, `cargo deny check advisories licenses` via taiki-e/install-action.
  `deny.toml`: permissive-license allow list (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, Zlib, MPL-2.0,
  CC0-1.0, BSL-1.0, …); 8 unmaintained-crate advisories from the leptos/tauri/xtask trees
  ignored with documented reasons (most disappear at the Phase 4 cutover). Clippy/test are
  scoped to catalog/core/xtask until the Phase 4 cutover (ui needs wasm32, app needs WebKitGTK).
- Verification: CI run `39112162370` on commit `560a5ce` completed with conclusion `success`
  (all four steps green). Also reproduced locally with cargo-deny 0.20.2: advisories ok,
  licenses ok.

**3. Characterization tests: `webhook_handler`**
- Work: 7 tests in `crates/core/src/webhook_handler.rs` — accept + persist + job enqueue
  (convo.created → sync_conversation), empty body → BadRequest, non-JSON body → BadRequest,
  wrong signature → SignatureInvalid, missing signature with secret set → SignatureInvalid,
  empty secret skips verification (characterizes CURRENT behavior; flips with plan item 6 /
  map row 1), duplicate event → same row id, drain_pending processes stored events.
- Verification: `cargo test -p supportos-plusplus-core` — 32/32 pass locally and in CI.

**4. Characterization tests: `backup_service`**
- Work: 4 tests in `crates/core/src/backup_service.rs` — backup creates a verified DB (VACUUM
  INTO, integrity_check ok) plus a `.settings.json` sidecar that redacts token/secret/password
  keys; verify_backup rejects non-database files; restore swaps the database file, removes
  stale `-wal`/`-shm`, and preserves data; restore reports missing backups; prune keeps the
  newest N and removes pruned sidecars.
- Verification: `cargo test -p supportos-plusplus-core` — 32/32 pass locally and in CI.

**5. Characterization tests: `encrypted_sync`**
- Work: 4 tests in `crates/core/src/encrypted_sync.rs` — export rejects passphrases < 8 chars;
  export→verify round-trip (SOSYNC magic present, no plaintext SQLite header in the bundle,
  right passphrase verifies, wrong passphrase rejected); tampered ciphertext fails GCM
  authentication; full import round-trip restores data with a `.pre-import-` safety backup.
- Verification: `cargo test -p supportos-plusplus-core` — 32/32 pass locally and in CI.

**Batch verification summary:** `cargo fmt --all --check` clean · `cargo clippy -D warnings`
clean (catalog/core/xtask, all targets) · `cargo test` 32/32 (15 new characterization tests +
17 pre-existing) · `cargo deny check advisories licenses` ok · GitHub Actions run
`39112162370` → success.

### Batch 2 — 2026-10-18 (commit `89f88b9`, CI run `39120945826`: success)

**6. Characterization tests: `hybrid_search` (RRF fusion vectors)**
- Work: 12 tests in `crates/core/src/hybrid_search.rs` — RRF constants pinned (k = 60 on both
  fusion paths), dense-only RRF math and order (1/61, 1/62, 1/63 exactly), item hit by both
  lists outranks single-list items, top-k truncation, payload prefers the dense source,
  custom-k variant, `merge_doc_hits` semantics (FTS+semantic label fusion, duplicate-id
  dedupe, tie-break by article id, list position not the rank field), cosine-similarity edge
  cases.
- Verification: `cargo test -p supportos-plusplus-core` — 61/61 pass locally and in CI.

**7. Characterization tests: SLA edge cases**
- Work: 13 new tests in `crates/core/src/business_hours.rs` — `parse_instant_ms` format matrix
  (date-only, explicit offset, space-separated naive, whitespace-trimmed, fractional seconds)
  and rejection matrix (blank, garbage, month 13, hour 25), equal bounds → 0.0, reversed range
  rejected, overnight windows unsupported (characterizes CURRENT behavior), weekend fully
  outside hours → 0.0 not None, DST transitions count real elapsed minutes, spans > 400 days
  rejected, `start_minute` clamped, out-of-range days dropped, SLA boundary inclusive, verdict
  matrix, timezone validation.
- Verification: `cargo test -p supportos-plusplus-core` — 61/61 pass locally and in CI.

**8. Add `xtask vector-count` command; record chunk count (D4 gate)**
- Work: `VectorCount` subcommand in `crates/xtask/src/bin/xtask.rs` — resolves the embedded
  qdrant store directory (new public `embedded_store_dir`, previously a private
  `EmbeddedQdrant::dir_for`), exact point count via new `EmbeddedQdrant::try_point_count`
  (`Ok(None)` when the collection does not exist yet), per-entity breakdown via new
  `count_by_entity` (knowledge / docs / conversation chunks), optional SQLite cross-check
  (row counts + `embedding_state = 'indexed'`), and the D4 gate verdict
  (< 100,000 chunks → sqlite-vec GO). `embeddings::entity_type_for` made public and
  documented. 2 unit tests over a seeded temp store.
- Verification: `cargo run -p supportos-plusplus-xtask -- vector-count` runs clean on an empty
  data dir (graceful "store not found → 0 points" path, prints `D4 gate -> 0 < 100000 chunks:
  sqlite-vec GO`); unit tests pass (61/61); CI green.
- Recorded count: 0 points (no production data yet) — re-run on seeded data before the
  Phase 5 swap (plan item 25).

**9. Pin toolchain to exact version; pin egui `=0.37` in workspace**
- Work: `rust-toolchain.toml` channel `stable` → `1.99.1` (exact pin; upgrades become
  deliberate, never silent). Workspace `Cargo.toml` gains `egui`/`eframe`/`egui_extras`/
  `egui_plot` all pinned `=0.37` (decision D1; first consumed by `crates/app-shell` in
  Phase 2). CI switched from `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` to `rustup toolchain install`
  so `rust-toolchain.toml` is the single source of truth. `Cargo.lock` regenerated
  (egui tree + hmac/sha1/hex). wasm32 target retained until the Phase 4 cutover.
- Verification: local fmt/clippy/test all on 1.99.1; CI installed the pinned toolchain and
  ran green on it.

**10. Row 2: replace hand-rolled HMAC/SHA-1/base64/hex with crates**
- Work: `crates/core/src/webhook.rs` — `compute_signature`/`verify_signature` now use
  `Hmac<Sha1>` (`hmac` 0.13 + `sha1` 0.11). Verification uses `Mac::verify_slice`
  (constant-time tag comparison) against the base64-decoded provided signature; invalid
  base64 → `Error::WebhookSignature`. ~120 lines of hand-rolled SHA-1, base64, and hex
  helper code deleted. Core gains direct `hmac`, `sha1`, `hex` deps (base64 was already
  direct).
- Verification: 4 new tests — RFC 2202 vectors (tests 1, 2, and 6 with a key longer than the
  64-byte block), the classic HMAC-SHA1 digest vector, determinism, and valid/tampered-body/
  wrong-key/invalid-encoding rejection. 61/61 pass locally and in CI.

**Batch verification summary:** `cargo fmt --all --check` clean · `cargo clippy --all-targets
-- -D warnings` clean (catalog/core/xtask, forced fresh run after touching all changed
inputs) · `cargo test -p supportos-plusplus-core` 61/61 (29 new + 32 pre-existing) ·
`cargo run -p supportos-plusplus-xtask -- vector-count` executes and prints the D4 gate
verdict · `cargo deny check advisories licenses` ok · GitHub Actions run `39120945826` →
success on commit `89f88b9`.
